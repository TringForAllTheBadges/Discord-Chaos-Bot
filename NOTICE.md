**Note: This project is no longer actively maintained and has been archived.**

This was an attempt to create a multi-purpose Discord bot with various features including music playback. Due to ongoing issues with dependencies and audio playback, the project has been archived.

Feel free to fork this repository if you'd like to continue development or use parts of the code for your own projects.

Thank you to everyone who showed interest in this project.
